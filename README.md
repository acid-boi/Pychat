Hi!
It is a python based internet relay chat application.
It can be used from anywhere globally.
It consists of mainly 2 scripts, 
			1.client.py
			2.server.py

The server.py needs to be deployed on a server with either a static ip address or on a pc where services such as port forwarding is running.
Currently the encryption algorithm is not implemented.

Note that this is just the basic working and many features are yet to be added.
